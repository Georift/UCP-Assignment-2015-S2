As a result of my testing I am convinced that this feature works well for 
good writers and not for bad ones  Good writers follow most of the rules and 
this feature can help them on the margins  If you are a bad writer with 
a poor udderstanding of the rules this feature will not help you at all  
this is clearly a problem  The feature does not help those who can most 
benefit from it
